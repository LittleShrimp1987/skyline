How to update from v1.2.2, v1.2.3, v1.2.4 or v1.2.5
---------------------------------------------------

- Download the new release tag or clone/update to get it to a temp location,
  ready to be deployed.
- Diff your current running version skyline/settings.py with the new version of
  skyline/settings.py and create a new settings.py in the temp location
  appropriate for Skyline v1.2.7 and your set up, ready to be deployed.
- Stop all the Skyline services and ensure any service controls such as monit,
  supervisor or systemd do not start them again, (change as appropriate for
  your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.7-stable-luminosity"    # Your new Skyline version
    OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.6-stable-luminosity"    # Your old Skyline version
    # OR
    # OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.2-stable-luminosity"
    # OLD_SKYLINE_VERSION="v1.2.3-stable-luminosity"
    # etc

    CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH="/opt/skyline/github/skyline"                 # Your Skyline path
    NEW_SKYLINE_PATH="${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"  # Your new Skyline path

    mkdir -p "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    cd "${CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH}.${NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION}"
    git clone https://github.com/earthgecko/skyline .
    git checkout "$NEW_SKYLINE_VERSION"

    # Stop all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    luminosity
    panorama
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i stop
    done

- Move your current Skyline directory to a backup directory and move the new
  Skyline v1.2.7 with your new settings.py from the temp location to your
  working Skyline directory, (change your paths as appropriate) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    mv /opt/skyline/github/skyline /opt/skyline/github/skyline.v1.2.6-luminosity-stable
    mv "$NEW_SKYLINE_PATH" "$CURRENT_SKYLINE_PATH"

- Start the all Skyline services (change as appropriate for your set up) e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Start all other Skyline services
    SKYLINE_SERVICES="panorama
    luminosity
    horizon
    analyzer
    mirage
    crucible
    boundary
    ionosphere
    webapp"
    for i in $SKYLINE_SERVICES
    do
      /etc/init.d/$i start
    done
